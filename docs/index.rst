Welcome to BioSim's documentation
==================================


BioSim is a Python package developed for creating and visualizing agent-based simulations of island ecosystems
consisting of various landscape and fauna.

The package was originally made to simulate the ecosystem of the fictional island of Rossumoya, yet it
allows for the simulation of island ecosystems with different configurations of landscape and fauna
through the user interface in the :class:`BioSim` class.
